    <h2>Historical Eras of Real Madrid</h2>
    <h3>1. The Early Years (1902-1940s)</h3>
    <p>
      Founded in 1902, Real Madrid quickly established itself as a dominant
      force in Spanish football. The club won its first Copa del Rey in 1905 and
      laid the groundwork for future success.
    </p>
    <h3>2. The Di Stéfano Era (1950s-1960s)</h3>
    <p>
      The arrival of Alfredo Di Stéfano in the 1950s marked the beginning of a
      golden era for Real Madrid. The club won five consecutive European Cups
      from 1956 to 1960, solidifying its status as a football powerhouse.
    </p>
    <h3>3. The Galácticos Era (2000s)</h3>
    <p>
      The early 2000s saw the emergence of the "Galácticos," a team filled with
      world-class stars like Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, and David Beckham. This
      era brought both domestic and international success, including multiple La
      Liga titles and a UEFA Champions League victory in 2002.
    </p>
    <h3>4. The La Decima and 3-peat Era (2010s-Present)</h3>
    <p>
      Under the management of Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, and Zinedine
      Zidane, Real Madrid achieved unprecedented success in the 2010s, winning
      three consecutive UEFA Champions League titles from 2016 to 2018. The club
      continues to be a dominant force in both Spanish and European football.
    </p>
    <h3>5. The Post-Zidane Era (2020s)</h3>
    <p>
      The departure of Zinedine Zidane marked the end of an era for Real Madrid.
      The club is currently in a transitional phase, focusing on integrating
      young talents while maintaining its competitive edge in domestic and
      European competitions.
